# Root out corruption everywhere

He didn't cheat!  Don't insult or defame him or he'll sue you!

So lichess.org has chosen to choose security thru obscurity.

Let's see how it goes 4 them.

There will be several parts to this the first will be defeating anti-bot
1. ANTIBOT
  Before you cheat in a game, you should write a bot sometimes they are simultaneous but without a bot you actually have to take actions in the game.

  Before we try to 'cheat' we should just try to you know 'play' but you know also not 'play'

  Details and implementation will be in Part1 - Registration and Anti Bot
