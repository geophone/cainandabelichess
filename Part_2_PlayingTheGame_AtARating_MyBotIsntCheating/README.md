iSo the idea here is to just play as a bot
Not gain or lose rating particularly to establish a game pattern this will make it harder to detect based on some heuristics over longer time scales

To dot his we need to remove all side channels
And normalize play as close to human players as possible

Hopefully this isn't too easy!  
Cause if it isn't I'll learn more
And lichess will suffer :(
